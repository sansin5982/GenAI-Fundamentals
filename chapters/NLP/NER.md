# Named Entity Recognition

### üß† What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?
**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is an NLP task that identifies and categorizes entities in text into predefined categories such as:
* **Person** (e.g., "Sandeep")
* **Organization** (e.g., "Odin")
* **Location** (e.g., "India", "Lucknow")
* **Date**, **Time**, **Money**, **Percent**, etc.

### üéØ Why is NER Used in Text Processing?

| Purpose                   | Explanation                                              |
|:------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîç Information Extraction | Helps extract names, places, events from large documents |
| üìÇ Text Structuring       | Adds semantic meaning to raw text                        |
| ü§ñ Dialogue Systems       | Enables chatbots to recognize real-world entities        |
| üß† Downstream NLP Tasks   | Useful for question answering, summarization, and more   |
