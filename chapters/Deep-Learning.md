# Introduction to Deep Learning

**Deep Learning (DL)** is a subfield of Machine Learning (ML) within
Artificial Intelligence (AI), focused on algorithms inspired by the
structure and function of the brain called **artificial neural
networks**. It allows computers to learn complex patterns from large
volumes of data to make decisions, predictions, or classifications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Basics of AI and Machine Learning

-   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: A broad field of computer science
    dedicated to creating machines capable of performing tasks typically
    requiring human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning,
    decision-making, and language understanding.

-   **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI, focusing on algorithms
    that improve their performance automatically through experience
    gained from data without being explicitly programmed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. AI, ML, and DL Distinctions

-   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Broad concept; encompasses any
    technology simulating human intelligence.
-   **Machine Learning (ML)**: AI subset; uses statistical methods and
    algorithms allowing systems to “learn” from data.
-   **Deep Learning (DL)**: ML subset; leverages multi-layer neural
    networks, particularly effective at learning from vast amounts of
    structured or unstructured data (e.g., images, speech, text).

## 3. Historical Developments and Significance

**Early Foundations (1940s–1950s)**: - Introduction of biological neuron
model by McCulloch & Pitts. - Perceptron developed by Frank Rosenblatt
(1957).

**Winter of AI and Revival (1970s–1990s)**: - Limitations of perceptron
identified (Minsky & Papert, 1969). - Emergence of backpropagation
algorithm (1986), sparking renewed interest in neural networks.

**Modern Era (2000s–Present)**: - Advances in computation (GPUs) and
large datasets. - Breakthroughs: ImageNet classification (2012), AlphaGo
victory (2016), ChatGPT (2022).

**Significance**: - DL has transformed technology fields, enabling
innovations in autonomous driving, healthcare diagnostics, natural
language processing, and robotics.

## 4. What is Deep Learning?

-   Deep learning algorithms model high-level abstractions in data
    through **multiple layers** of nonlinear transformations.
-   Each layer progressively extracts more complex features from raw
    input.
-   Enables automatic extraction and representation of information
    directly from data, surpassing manual feature engineering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Biological Inspiration (Neural Networks Analogy)

-   Inspired by the **structure of biological neurons** in human brains.
-   Biological neurons receive input signals, process them, and transmit
    output to other neurons.
-   Similarly, artificial neurons receive inputs (data), weigh these
    inputs, apply an activation function, and produce outputs.
-   Networks of interconnected artificial neurons form the basis of DL
    models.
